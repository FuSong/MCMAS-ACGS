# Making Agents' Abilities Explicit 
In this work, we extended Concurrent Game Structures with agents' abilities and studied the semantics of ATLK* under this new system model. Furthermore, we gave model checking algorithms for ATLK/ATLK*,  and implemented them as a prototype tool named MCMAS_ACGS based on MCMAS Model checker from [Lomuscio et al](https://vas.doc.ic.ac.uk/software/mcmas/).
